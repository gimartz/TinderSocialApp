## ðŸŽ¯ Assumptions Made

1. **No Authentication**: The app uses a mock user profile and doesn't require login
2. **Static Data**: All user profiles and messages are hardcoded (no API integration)
3. **No Real-time Updates**: Messages don't update in real-time (no WebSocket/Firebase)
4. **Single User Perspective**: The app shows a single user's view of matches and chats
5. **Simplified Matching**: Swiping right doesn't require mutual matching to enable chat
6. **No Image Upload**: Profile pictures use placeholder URLs
7. **Basic Profile**: Profile screen shows minimal user information
8. **No Message Sending**: Chat interface is read-only (displays mock messages)
